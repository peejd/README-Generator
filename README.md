# README.md Generator


## Description

This simple, command-line program creates a properly formatted README markdown file based on user responses to terminal prompts using the Inquirer npm.

This project challenged me greatly to begin using my recently learned knowledge of command-line programs using Javascript, Node.js, and NPMs.



## Installation

To use this program on your computer, follow these steps:

1 - Ensure Node.js is installed on your local computer.

2 - Using VS Code, pull the index.js file from this GitHub repo into a directory on your local computer

3 - In VS Code, right-click on the diretory where the index.js file is located and select "Open in Integrated Terminal".

4 - On the command line, type "npm init" and then hit Enter.

5 - On the command line, type "npm install --save inquirer@^8.2.4" and then hit Enter. Wait while your computer downloads the older version of Inquirer npm and its corresponding modules.



## Usage

Following the installation steps above, to generate your README file, follow these steps:

1 - On the command line, type "node index.js" and then hit Enter.

2 - Type answers to each of the command line prompts that appear followed by the Enter key to generate the content for your README file.

3 - After submitting your response to the last question, the program will write a new file named "README.md" to the same directory.

4 - Right-click on the file and select "Open Preview" to view the formatted README in the VS Code previewer.
